# Testing what isn't there

Up until this point, we have been writing tests and assertions to make sure that things are displayed correctly. For instance, our `should append new items to the bottom of the list` test makes sure that our todo's are listed in the correct order and that the todo count text is correct.

This is all well and good, but it is also important to write tests to make sure that things are _not_ shown when they are not supposed to be. So instead of testing the positive case, make sure to also test the negative.

This will make more sense when we write our first "negative" test. For instance, I am not sure if you noticed this or not, but when a todo is added to the application a `<footer>` is appended to the bottom of the app. When there are no todo's the `<footer>` is removed.

Let's write a test to make sure that the `<footer>` is not visible to our users when there are no todos.

```jsx
it("does NOT display the footer when there are no todos", () => {})
```

Now let's grab the `<footer>` element and write an assertion that it does not exist when there are no todos.

```jsx
cy.get(".footer").should("not.exist")
```

Great our test is passing. Let's also think of some other elements that should not exist when there are no todo's.

Another element that should not exist is our `.todo-list` element. Let's write another assertion to make sure that this too does not exist if there are no todo's.

```jsx
cy.get(".todo-list").should("not.exist")
```

Since we now checking for multiple elements, let's update our test name to be more explicit.

```jsx
it("does NOT display the footer or todo-list when there are no todos", () => {
  cy.get(".footer").should("not.exist")
  cy.get(".todo-list").should("not.exist")
})
```

## Practice:

Now that you know how to test for when things should not exist, write a new test that does the opposite of the test we just wrote. Instead of making sure something does not exist when there are no todo's, write a test that makes sure that the `<footer>` and `.todo-list` exist when there are todo's.

## Wrap Up:

In this lesson we learned the importance of writing "negative" tests, which in this case was to make sure that certain elements did not exist if there were no todo's.

In just a handful of lessons, we have covered a lot of material and learned how to write tests with Cypress. Hopefully, this section has been helpful in not only teaching you the "how," but also the "why." Remember testing is a mindset, and it takes time to learn how to develop that mindset.

In this section, we only wrote a few tests, but we could easily write dozens more. To see an example of all the possible tests that can be written for this simple todo app, take a look at the master branch of the [repo](https://github.com/robertguss/cypress-example-todomvc). Within the `cypress/integration/app_spec.js` file you will find dozens of tests with tons of code comments describing what each test is doing.

Before moving on to the next section, make sure to read through this file thoroughly. Also fire up Cypress and watch all of these tests execute. Click on each test in the left sidebar of the runner to see what it is doing. You will most likely be quite surprised that you can write so many tests for such a simple todo app.

Not only does this repo contain lots of helpful tests and examples, but it also contains best practices that we recommend.
