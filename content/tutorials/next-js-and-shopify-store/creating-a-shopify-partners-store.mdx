# Creating a Shopify Partners Store

## Creating a Shopify Partners Store

The first thing you will need is a [Shopify Partners Account](https://www.shopify.com/partners). It is completely free to sign up. The Shopify Partners account will allow us to create as many development stores as we need for free, which is exactly what we want. You do not want to sign up for the Shopify Trial found on their home page.

Once you have created your account, you should land on the Shopify Partners dashboard.

Click on the Stores link in the left sidebar and then click on the "Add store" button.

Click on "Development store"

Then proceed to fill out the "Login information" section. 

- Your store will need to have a unique url
- We won't need the password for this tutorial, but you have to add one to create your store. It doesn't have to be anything fancy or complex as this is just a demo store.

Leave "Developer preview" unchecked as we do not need any unreleased features for this tutorial. Also make sure to fill out a real address for your store. I simply used my home address.

For the "Store purpose," check "I'm just playing around" and then click on the purple save button.

Shopify will then create you store and take you to your store's dashboard.

## Adding Products

Since we are creating a developer swag store, we are going to need some swag for our store. I will be using some images I found from [Redbubble.com](https://www.redbubble.com/shop/developer+t-shirts) but feel free to use whatever you would like. I will only be adding three products, but you can certainly add more if you would like. 

Once you have the images of your products, click on the "Add product" button on your store's dashboard.

Make sure to mark the "Product status" as active. 

Here is a screenshot of the entire "Add product" screen with all of the information filled out. If you don't know what all of these fields are, just fill them out as I have in this screenshot.

When all of the fields are filled, click Save.

Repeat this for all of your products.

Once all of your products have been added, you should see something like this on the product screen. You can find the products page by clicking on the "Products" link in the left sidebar.

Make sure that all of your products have a Status of "Active."

## Storefront API

Since we will be using a custom Next.js frontend for our shop, we need to install the [Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/api/storefront) from shopify within our store. 

Click on "Apps" in the left side bar. 

![Screen Shot 2021-12-16 at 9.41.06 AM.png](Creating%20a%202cd4f/Screen_Shot_2021-12-16_at_9.41.06_AM.png)

At the bottom of this page, click on the link that says, "Manage private apps."

![Screen Shot 2021-12-16 at 9.42.00 AM.png](Creating%20a%202cd4f/Screen_Shot_2021-12-16_at_9.42.00_AM.png)

Click on the "Enable private app development" button.

![Screen Shot 2021-12-16 at 9.42.29 AM.png](Creating%20a%202cd4f/Screen_Shot_2021-12-16_at_9.42.29_AM.png)

Make sure to check all of the checkboxes and then click the "Enable private app development" button.

![Screen Shot 2021-12-16 at 9.43.45 AM.png](Creating%20a%202cd4f/Screen_Shot_2021-12-16_at_9.43.45_AM.png)

Then click on the "Create private app" button.

Fill out the form and enable the following checkboxes and features for the Storefront API.

Once you click on the Save button, your API token will be generated. 

![Screen Shot 2021-12-16 at 9.47.03 AM.png](Creating%20a%202cd4f/Screen_Shot_2021-12-16_at_9.47.03_AM.png)

![Screen Shot 2021-12-16 at 9.47.37 AM.png](Creating%20a%202cd4f/Screen_Shot_2021-12-16_at_9.47.37_AM.png)

We will need to use this API token in order to have our Next.js application retrieve our products from Shopify.
