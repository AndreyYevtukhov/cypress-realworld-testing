# Deploying to Vercel

In this final section of our tutorial, we are going to be learning how to deploy our Next.js and Shopify application live to Vercel.

First, if you do not already have a free account with Vercel, you will need to create one at [https://vercel.com/signup](https://vercel.com/signup). We recommend using your GitHub account to do so.

Once you are logged in, click on the “New Project” button. You will then be presented with a screen where you can import your Git Repository. Find your repo and click the blue “Import” button next to it.

Vercel will automatically detect that we are using Next.js and setup the build and output settings for us. However, we modified the name of the build directory so we will need to update that. Click on the “Build and Output Settings dropdown” and then toggle the “Override” next to the “Output Directory”

Next, we will need to add our environment variables. Toggle the “Environment Variables” dropdown. Then add each environment variable within the `.env.local` in the root of the project repo. For reference, mine looks like this:

```yaml
COMMERCE_PROVIDER=shopify
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=b59e6b070be0eba9e59d5f19255e44e6
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=nextjs-ecommerce-demo.myshopify.com
```

You will have to add each variable one at a time. Once all of them have been added, it should look like this:

Finally, click on the “Deploy” button. If you have done everything correctly, you should be presented with a Congratulations screen.

After clicking on the “Go to Dashboard” button you will be taken to the dashboard of your application.

You can then click on the “Visit” button to see your live application.

## Wrap Up

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a custom Next.js front-end using Shopify as our back-end. We also learned how to test our app with Cypress. We then learned how to run our tests against each Pull Request with GitHub Actions. We then integrated the Cypress dashboard to have all of our tests run in parallel. Finally, we deployed our application live to Vercel.
