# Creating the Next.js App

## Creating the Next.js App

Now that our Shopify store is all setup and configured we will need to create the Next.js front-end for it. Fortunately, the amazing team at Vercel has already provided us with a project which we can use for our store.

We will be using the Next.js Commerce application, which you can find more about [here](https://nextjs.org/commerce).

## Cloning & Installing the App

First, you will need to fork the [Next.js Commerce Repo](https://github.com/vercel/commerce).

Once you have forked their repo, you will need to clone it down locally to your machine.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/commerce.git
```

Then `cd` into the repo and install all of the NPM dependencies with yarn.

```bash
cd commerce
yarn install
```

Next, we will need to change providers in the app to Shopify. We can follow along with the directions in the [README](http://README.md) of the repo under the ‚ÄúHow to change providers‚Äù section.

Create a file called `.env.local` inside of the `site/` directory. Open `site/.env.local` and update it to look like the following.

üí° You will need your Shopify Storefront API key and the domain of your store.

```bash
# site/.env.local

COMMERCE_PROVIDER=@vercel/commerce-shopify
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=7313c9dc3c0344ddfcde896e3d03a405
NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=nextjs-ecommerce-demo-2.myshopify.com/
```

Next, within your terminal start up the development server.

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open your browser to `[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)` and you should see your store and your products from Shopify.
